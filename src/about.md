I've always liked computers. Whether it was fussing over
exactly which WinAmp skin to pair with my desktop background or managing
BBForums for my RuneScape clan while hanging out in the [#runescape] IRC
channel for [tip.it], I was "extremely online" even as an adolescent.

I've written a lot of weirdly specific applications over the years:

<div style="clear: both;">

- Testing cable effectiveness when plugged into an oscilloscope.

- Creating thermal printer libraries in Tcl.

- Photobooth applications for hardware that was mounted to a shopping cart,
  for capturing nutrition labels on food.

- A mesh network for peer-to-peer communication between containers on cargo
  ships.

These days, I'm a bit more focused on web development. I'm a Senior Principal
at [Disney] working on streaming. Outside of work, I like to write about
Home Automation and obsess a bit over Apple products.

When I'm not building things, I like cooking, watching TV, and spending time
with my wife and cat. I also listen to _a lot_ of podcasts.

You can find all of my half-finished projects on [GitHub]. I'm also on
[Mastodon], [Instagram], and [LinkedIn]. If you just want to reach me
directly, you can send an email to

## This Site

This site is built using [Eleventy], a static site generator. You can
find the source on [GitHub][source].

The inspiration for the theme, sitemap, and format of this site came from
a bunch of different people with their own personal websites:

- [localghost.dev]'s "minimal" theme hit _really_ close to the format I wanted
  to use on my own site. (Though I hope it doesn't feel too ripped from that.)

- [Robb Knight][rknight]'s personal site gave me a lot of inspiration on [using APIs]
  to generate content for some of the pages that I wanted to build.

- I liked the layout for posts and reading time that I found on [codevoid]'s site.

- Code snippets in posts use [Sarah Drasner]'s [Night Owl] light theme, which was
  made by forking the [PrismJS version].

And so many more people that I'm probably forgetting.
