  <h1 class="page-heading">Hello there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Drew, and I make stuff on the internet. I live in Seattle with my wife,
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashley_nicole_hays/">Ashley</a>,
    and my cat, Phoebe. I'm currently a Senior Principal Engineer at
    <a href="https://disneyplus.com/">Disney</a> working on streaming, and previously 
    worked at <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>, and 
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>.

    I like to <a href="/posts">write</a> about home automation and tech in general,
    but that's never stopped me from writing about anything else.
